# Mean Field Variational Inference in Bayesian Neural Networks

This repository contains an implementation of a Bayesian neural network on a toy regression dataset, using the mean field variational approximation. This implementation was completed as part of a student researcher summer role with the Machine Learning Group at Cambridge, supervised by Matt Ashman (officially Adrian Weller). The purpose of this toy implementation was to familiarise myself with PyTorch, as I would need to be comfortable using it for experiments with more novel models later on in the summer. The notebook consists of three main sections: dataset generation, regular neural network implementation, Bayesian neural network implementation.
